This is crucial when you have dependencies between pipelines, where one pipeline needs to complete successfully before another can begin. Without orchestration, scheduling pipelines to run independently might lead to failures or unexpected results if a dependent pipeline runs before its required data is ready.","permalink":"/datagol-knowlegde-base-v1/docs/Lakehouse/Orchestrations/Creating Orchestrations"},{"id":"Lakehouse/Datasources","title":"Datasources","description":"From the Data Source section you can connect to a wide range of data platforms.
