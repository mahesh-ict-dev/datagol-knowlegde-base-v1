## Schema Change Detection

DataGOL's Schema Change Detection feature monitors the source tables involved in your pipelines for any modifications to their structure (e.g., new columns, deleted columns, data type changes). This helps you stay informed about potential impacts on your data pipelines and warehouse. When a schema change is detected, it is recorded, indicating the table, the modified columns, and the nature of the change (e.g., data type, size).

Proactive monitoring of schema changes is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of your data pipelines. DataGOL alerts you to these changes so you can take necessary actions.

After verifying the changes, you can mark the change as verified. For more details of the schema changes, click View Details button.
