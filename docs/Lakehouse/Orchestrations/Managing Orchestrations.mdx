You can manage and monitor the orchestrations from the Orchestrations page. The main Orchestration page display a list of all created orchestrations.

Click Run to run an orchestration directly. You can view the details of the pipeline such as the created time/date, owner, last initiation, and status of the run from this page

-   Edit the orchestration. Refer to [Editing an orchestration.](https://saasxl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/documentation/pages/220692503/DataGOL+Documentation#Editing-an-Orchestration)
    
-   Add users to your orchestration. If they do not already have access to associated pipelines, they will be granted permissions. Only Lakehouse members can be added, and they will receive creator permissions by default. Also refer to [Adding users to an orchestration](https://saasxl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/documentation/pages/220692503/DataGOL+Documentation#Adding-members-to-Orchestration)
    

By default Lakehouse admins in a company will have access to all orchestrations created by any member.

Only Lakehouse members can be added because Lakehouse admins already have permissions to all orchestrations and pipelines.
