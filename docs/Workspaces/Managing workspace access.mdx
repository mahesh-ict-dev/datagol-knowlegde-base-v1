## Managing workspace access

You can also specify the workspace access settings while creating a workspace. Refer to [Creating a workspace](https://saasxl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/documentation/pages/220692503/DataGOL+Documentation#Creating-a-workspace).

1.  On the Home page, from the left navigation panel, click Workspace. The Workspace page, which lists all the workspaces is displayed.
    
2.  Click the three dots on the workspace icon and select Edit. The Update Workspace page is displayed.
    
3.  Specify or edit the discovery settings of the Workspace.
    

-   Open to members: Company members can locate such workspaces and join freely. These workspaces are open and you can join such workspaces without any permissions.
    
-   Members can join after approval: Company members can find the Workspace and request access, which the admin must then approve. By default viewer role is given.
    
-   Hidden: Only members specifically invited by the admin can see and enter the Workspace.
