### Workspace users - Roles and permissions

-   Owners and Creators:  
    The Creator role is assigned to the user who creates the workspace or is designated as the workspace owner. This role grants the highest level of control within the workspace.
    
-   Editors:  
    Editors are users who have significant control over the content within the workspace. They can create, edit, and manage various types of content.
    
-   Viewers:  
    Viewers have restricted permissions and primarily possess read-only access to the workspace content.
    

By understanding these roles and permissions, workspace administrators can effectively manage access and ensure that each user has the appropriate level of interaction with the content. Proper assignment of roles helps maintain security, streamline collaboration, and enhance productivity within the workspace.
