Workspace provides a collaborative environment where you can interact with your data together. Inside Workspaces, you can create, edit, and share workbooks. Depending on your organization's needs, you can have multiple workspaces or a single one.

You have the flexibility to invite both internal and external users to collaborate within your workspace. Granular permissions can be assigned to invited users through predefined roles, which ensures appropriate access and control over workspace content and settings. The available roles are:

-   Viewer: This role grants users the ability to interact with the data by applying filters and creating personalized views. However, Viewers cannot modify the underlying content of the workbooks.
    
-   Editor: Has all the Viewer permissions plus the Editor can modify workbooks that are not directly connected to a dynamic data source.
    
-   Creator: This role encompasses all Editor capabilities and provides administrative control over the workspace. Creators can manage settings, enable delete protection, configure workbook permissions, and control sharing options.
    

By understanding and strategically assigning these roles, workspace administrators can effectively manage collaboration while maintaining data integrity and security.
