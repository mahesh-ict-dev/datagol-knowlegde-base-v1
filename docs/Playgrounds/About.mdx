Playground is a versatile and interactive environment for users to engage with their data in an exploratory and flexible manner. This module acts as a space where you can connect to various data sources and play around with the information they contain.

Instead of pulling all available data, which can be inefficient and increase system load, the Playground environment allows you to selectively retrieve and analyze specific subsets of data relevant to your needs.

You can run queries on your data sources and visualize the results quickly. This is achieved through the ability to write and execute SQL queries directly against the connected data sources. Playground empowers users to understand their data better, extract valuable insights, and prepare data for further analysis or reporting.

Furthermore, Playground incorporates an intelligent SQL co-pilot, leveraging artificial intelligence to assist users in generating SQL queries.

## Creating queries in playground

You can create queries in Playground to interact with your data sources in two ways: directly writing SQL or leveraging AI assistance.
