The Playground helps you connect and analyze data from different sourcesâ€”like combining employee data from MySQL with department info from Excel.

To connect external data to workbooks via Playground, do the following:

1.  Identify the Workbook table name:
    

-   Navigate to the workbook page.
    
-   Click the more options icon next to a workbook. The table name is revealed at the end of the dropdown. Click the adjacent copy icon to copy the table name.
    
-   Open image-20250512-073420.png
    
-   Carefully copy this table name. For instance, it might look something like table_a1b2c3d4.
    

3.  Construct your query in the playground:
    

-   Open the Playground interface.
    
-   Write your query to join or integrate the external data with your workbook data.
    
-   Reference your workbook data using the following convention: app_connection.`<your_copied_table_name>.`  
    Example: To join your MySQL employees table with the workbook table table_a1b2c3d4 on a common department_id column, your query might look like this:
    
``` 
SQL Query Looks like

SELECT
e.employee_name,
d.department_name
FROM
your_mysql_connection.employees e
JOIN
app_connection.table_a1b2c3d4 d ON e.department_id = d.dept_id;

```


-   Replace `your_mysql_connection` with the actual name of your MySQL connection configured in the platform.
    
-   Adjust the column names (employee_name, department_name, department_id, dept_id) to match your specific data structures.
    

3.  Execute Your Query:
    

-   Once your query is constructed, execute it within the Playground environment.
    

5.  Visualize and utilize the combined data:
    

-   The Playground will display the results of your combined dataset.
    
-   From here, you can visualize the joined data, create new views or tables within your workbook, or further analyze the integrated information.
