## About Workbook

In today's data-driven world, the ability to effectively manage and derive insights from information is paramount. Workbooks provide a versatile solution, empowering you to organize, analyze, and visualize your data with ease. Whether you are building dynamic reports or managing critical datasets, understanding the capabilities of workbooks is key to unlocking your data's full potential.

Workbooks provide a robust and flexible framework for managing your data lifecycle. From static, automatically updated datasets to dynamic, fully customizable workbooks, coupled with intelligent features and granular access control, this platform empowers you to effectively organize, analyze, and visualize your information, driving informed decisions and unlocking valuable insights.

Workbooks also enable the creation of formulas, allowing for the generation of distinct subviews tailored for insightful data visualization.

Your workspace serves as the central hub for your workbooks. These workbooks can be created in the following ways:

-   Manual create blank workbook
    
-   Published from Playground
    
-   File upload (Excel or CSV)
    

Workbook types: There are two types of workbooks in DataGOL:

-   Static Workbooks (Non-Editable): These workbooks function as dynamic representations of your data. Powered by a data source, they automatically update to reflect the latest information, ensuring your insights are always current. A lock icon clearly identifies these workbooks, signifying their datasource-driven nature and non-editable by users.

-   Dynamic Workbooks (Editable): These workbooks are either created manually or uploaded from a file and can be edited with the appropriate permissions. You can customize them to your specific needs by adding new columns, applying filters, and incorporating powerful formulas.
    

Static workbooks now exclusively use Spark functions, while dynamic workbooks utilize JDBC functions.

Workbook deletion safeguard: Your valuable work in workbooks can be safeguarded with delete protection a built-in feature. This acts as a crucial safeguard, preventing accidental deletions, especially for workbooks integral to reports, dashboards, or other critical workflows.

Importantly, admin control ensures that only authorized users can enable or disable this protection.

Grouping workbooks: Group workbooks in folders by shared attributes for better organization and faster access.

Column types in a workbook: To enrich your data and tailor it to your specific needs, workbooks support a diverse range of column types:

-   Single Line Text: For concise text entries.
