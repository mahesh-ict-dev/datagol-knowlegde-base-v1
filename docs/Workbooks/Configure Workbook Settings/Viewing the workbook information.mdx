### Viewing the workbook information

1.  On the Home page, from the left navigation panel, click Workspace and from the list of workspaces, open the workspace where the workbook that you want to edit is located.
    
2.  Click the Workbook tab and select the required workbook.
    
3.  Click the Settings button on the top and select Workbook info.
    

Grid View is the main screen in the workbook, showing all the columns and your complete data in a table format. It gives you a full overview.

Subview: This is a focused part of the main grid view. You create it by filtering the data to see only specific information. For example, in a list of all sales, a subview could show only the sales from the last quarter.

The grid view is the whole table, and a subview is like zooming in on a specific section of that table to look closer at certain data. This helps you analyze specific parts of your data more easily.
