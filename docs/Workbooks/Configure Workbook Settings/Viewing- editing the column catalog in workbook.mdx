### Viewing/editing the column catalog in workbook

The Column Catalog maps each workbook column to its corresponding source column from connected data sources. Any metadata cataloged at the data source level is automatically surfaced at the workbook column. If a column is derived from multiple sources, descriptions from each level will be shown. Its primary purpose is to help users trace the raw source and inherit cataloging information.

1.  On the Home page, from the left navigation panel, click Workspace and from the list of workspaces, open the workspace where the workbook that you want to edit is located.
    
2.  Click the Workbook tab and select the required workbook.
    
3.  Click the Settings button on the top and select Column catalog. The column information is displayed.
    
4.  Optionally, you can turn on the Edit toggle to edit the column details.
    
5.  click Save.
