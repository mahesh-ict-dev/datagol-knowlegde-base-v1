### Accessing workbook pipeline information

1.  On the Home page, from the left navigation panel, click Workspace and from the list of workspaces, open the workspace where the workbook that you want to edit is located.
    
2.  Click the Workbook tab and select the required workbook.
    
3.  Click the Settings button on the top and select View pipeline. The pipeline information is displayed.
    

-   You can readily view the underlying query driving this workbook, an option available for workbooks connected to a data source.
    
-   To modify the query, navigate to the pipeline and edit the corresponding stream.
    
-   If this workbook was published directly from the Playground without creating a copy, you'll have the convenience of editing the query directly from the panel within the workbook itself.
    
-   You can view the freshness of your data here, along with the status of the Last Mile Pipeline, which handles the final step of moving data from S3 storage into DB storageâ€”converting it into a more accessible format for querying and analysis.
