### Viewing the column dependency graph

A column dependency graph visualizes how columns are connected through formulasâ€”showing chains where one formula-based column depends on another. It helps identify which columns are safe to delete and allows you to inspect dependencies for any specific column.

2.  Click the Workbook tab and select the required workbook.
    
3.  Click the Settings button on the top and select Column dependency graph.
