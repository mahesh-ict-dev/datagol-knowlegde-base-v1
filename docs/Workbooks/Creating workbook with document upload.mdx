### Creating workbook with document upload

For document uploads, both CSV and Excel files are supported. However, for enhanced functionality and integration capabilities, it is recommended to upload these file types as workbooks. Also, note that the preview feature is currently available only for images and PDF documents.

1.  On the Home page, from the left navigation panel, click Workspace and from the list of workspaces, open a workspace.
    
2.  Click the Documents tab.
    
3.  From the left panel, at the bottom, click Import.
    
4.  In the Documents box, you can do the following:
    

-   Create a folder and upload a file to that folder
    
-   Upload files from your systems
    
-   Sort the files
    
-   Drag and drop the files that you want to upload.
    

6.  Click New button to add a new folder or upload a file from the system. The uploaded files/folders are listed in the Documents tab. Once uploaded, you can download the file or preview it.
