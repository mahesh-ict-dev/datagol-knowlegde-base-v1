### Viewing Workbook Lineage

The workbook Lineage View offers a visual representation of how data flows from raw sources through pipelines into workbooks, helping users trace, audit, and understand column-level transformations.

### Structure

-   Nodes represent data sources (e.g. MySQL, S3, PostgreSQL) or workbooks.
    
-   Edges represent pipelines that move or transform data between nodes.
