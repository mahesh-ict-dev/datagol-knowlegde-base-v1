This guide outlines the data visualization possibilities within our BI tool. Understand how to combine your data columns with different widgets to uncover insights. This guide will help a business user understand what visualizations they can expect to be suggested and how their data (Dimensions, Metrics, Date Times) will generally be used if they pick that suggestion.
# Core data column types
| Column type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| D (Dimension/Attribute) | Categorical data used for grouping or labeling. Examples: Product Name, Region, Status. Includes text and single-select fields. |
| M (Metric/Measure) | Numerical data that can be aggregated. Examples: Sales, Quantity, Profit. Includes numbers, currency, and percentages. |
| DTT (Date Time - Truncated) | Date or timestamp data grouped to a specific time unit (e.g., Year, Month, Day). Useful for seeing trends over distinct periods. |
| DTP (Date Time - Part) | Extracts a specific part of a date (e.g., Month of Year, Day of Week, Hour). Useful for analyzing cyclical patterns. |

Configuration is flexible.                                                                     |

## General notes for auto-configuration
- "First" Column:When multiple columns of the same type are selected (e.g., two Metrics), the system often picks the "first" one by default for a primary role.
- Default Metric:If you select Dimensions or Date Times but no Metrics for some charts, a default Metric (like "Count of Rows") might be automatically used for the Y-axis.
- Flexibility:This is a guide toautomatic suggestions and initial setup. You can always customize the widget further once it's created!
- Availability:Some advanced or specialized chart types may only be suggested if your data very specifically matches their requirements (e.g., stock data for Candlestick charts). Widgets/charts listed as "NOT_SUPPORTED" in the underlying code won't be auto-suggested or available.
