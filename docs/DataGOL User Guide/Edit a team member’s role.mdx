## Special considerations for Account Admin Role

If you want to add roles to a member who is an **Account Admin**, the roles won’t be visible on the teams page initially. However, when you click the more options icon, all available roles will be displayed.
If you delete the Account Admin role and add another role, the new role will appear on the teams page.
For members who are not listed as Account Admins, click , and add different roles, and the changes are immediately reflected on the Teams page.
