# Using your own AWS - Azure storage with DataGOL

DataGOL seamlessly integrates with both AWS and Azure cloud storage, offering you flexibility in choosing your primary data location. By default, DataGOL utilizes its own managed AWS and Azure resources for storage, ensuring immediate and hassle-free operation.

While the platform's default configuration with its own AWS access keys is recommended for most users, you have the option to designate a specific AWS account for all your organization's DataGOL storage needs. Similarly, while DataGOL provides its own managed Azure storage for smooth operation, you can also choose to use your own Azure account by providing the necessary access key credentials. This allows companies requiring specific account separation or integration with existing cloud infrastructure to tailor their DataGOL storage setup.
